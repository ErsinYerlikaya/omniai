      <div class="news-meta">
      </div>
      <div class="news-body">
        The German government has unveiled a national AI strategy aimed at making artificial intelligence a key economic
        driver by 2030. Dubbed an “AI offensive,” the plan targets <strong>10% of Germany’s GDP to be AI-based by
          2030</strong>, seeking to narrow the technology gap with the US and China. The draft strategy outlines
        investments in large-scale AI processing centers (“<strong>AI Gigafactories</strong>”) coordinated with industry
        and federal states. Brussels is backing infrastructure expansion with <strong>€20 billion</strong> earmarked by
        the European Commission for AI/data facilities. The German plan also sets goals in quantum computing (two
        error-corrected quantum computers by 2030) and emphasizes public-private cooperation. The Cabinet is expected to
        approve the strategy within the month, underscoring Germany’s commitment to AI-driven innovation.

      <div class="news-meta">
      </div>
      <div class="news-body">
        The European Commission has published a <strong>General-Purpose AI Code of Practice</strong> to help providers
        of large AI models align with upcoming EU regulations. Drafted by 13 experts with input from over 1,000
        stakeholders, the voluntary Code offers guidelines on <strong> transparency, copyright, safety, and
          security</strong> for foundation-model AI. It supports compliance with the EU’s <strong>AI Act</strong> rules
        taking effect in August 2025, which will require makers of broadly-used AI systems to implement risk assessments
        and transparency measures. Companies that sign the Code and follow its recommended practices will enjoy greater
        legal certainty and reduced bureaucracy. This initiative reflects Europe’s push for <strong>responsible AI
          innovation</strong>, ensuring powerful AI models are <strong>safe, transparent, and trustworthy.</strong>

      <div class="news-meta">

      <div class="news-body">
        At UNESCO’s <strong>3rd Global Forum on AI Ethics</strong> in Bangkok, international leaders called for turning
        AI ethics principles into concrete actions. The forum highlighted progress since UNESCO’s landmark 2021 AI
        Ethics Recommendation, noting that dozens of countries have begun integrating ethical frameworks and conducting
        AI readiness assessments. New global cooperation platforms were announced, including a <strong>Network of AI
          Supervisory Authorities</strong> and a civil society & academia network, to strengthen cross-border governance
        of AI. A key message was that <strong>international and regional collaboration is urgently needed</strong> to
        ensure AI develops in a human-centric, <strong>responsible</strong> manner. Officials stressed moving beyond
        principles: implementing oversight mechanisms and sharing best practices so that ethical guidelines lead to
        real-world impact.

      <div class="news-meta">
      </div>
      <div class="news-body">
        A new annual <strong>State of AI</strong> report reveals that the global AI landscape is more competitive than
        ever. According to the analysis (from Stanford’s HAI), <strong>high-performing Chinese AI models</strong> have
        sharply increased in number and quality, rapidly <strong>challenging US leadership</strong> in the field. The
        performance edge between top American and Chinese models is now narrowing, as evidenced by benchmark tests and
        research output. Additionally, 2024 saw breakthrough progress in <strong>efficient AI systems</strong>, with
        smaller, optimized models matching the capabilities of previous large “behemoth” models. These trends indicate a
        tightening AI race, driven by China’s heavy R&D investments and talent growth. Experts say businesses worldwide
        should watch this evolving balance, as it may spur faster innovation and more diverse AI solutions.

      <div class="news-body">
        At its Build 2025 conference, <strong>Microsoft announced new tools for organizations to tailor AI to their
          needs</strong>. The company introduced <strong>Microsoft 365 Copilot “Tuning”</strong>, a low-code service
        that lets enterprises train Microsoft’s AI Copilot on their own data, workflows, and style guides. This enables
        companies to create domain-specific AI assistants – for example, a law firm can generate an agent that drafts
        documents in the firm’s preferred format and tone. Microsoft also unveiled <strong>multi-agent
          orchestration</strong> in Copilot Studio, allowing multiple specialized agents to collaborate on complex
        tasks. These updates, delivered within Microsoft’s secure cloud boundary, let businesses harness AI more
        accurately and securely.

        emphasize four core principles for researchers: <strong>Reliability, Honesty, Respect</strong>, and <strong>
          Accountability</strong>. This means AI models used in research should be robust and unbiased, methods and data
        handling should be transparent and fair, and privacy, intellectual property, and human dignity must be
        safeguarded. Researchers are urged to clearly label AI-generated content and ensure human oversight in study
        design. These guidelines, while non-binding, are intended to shape <strong>responsible AI innovation</strong> in
        academic and applied fields.

        The European Commission has released an updated set of <strong>Clauses for AI procurement (MCC-AI)</strong>,
        giving public agencies a template to demand <strong>responsible AI practices</strong> from vendors. The clauses
        align with the EU’s draft AI Act, mirroring obligations for <strong>“high-risk” AI systems</strong> (e.g. in
        hiring or healthcare). They cover key areas such as <strong>risk assessment, data governance, transparency,
          human oversight</strong>, and cybersecurity measures. The MCC-AI package includes a full version for high-risk
        AI, a lighter version for lower-risk cases, and detailed guidance. While designed for public-sector contracts,
        these standards can be adopted by companies as well to foster compliance and trust.
